# About Book Bits
Book Bits automates ebooks in EPUB format to audiobooks using AI technology. With a single click, you can transform any ebook into a professional audiobook experience, enabling users to listen in their preferred language through automatic translation. This feature makes content accessible across languages, providing a seamless reading experience for diverse audiences.

## Features
- AI-Powered Audiobook Creation: Automatically transform ebooks (EPUB format) into professional-grade audiobooks with a single click.
- Multilingual Support: Listen to the book in your preferred language with seamless automatic AI translation.
- Accessibility Across Languages: Enhance accessibility by breaking language barriers, making content available to diverse audiences.
- Effortless User Experience: Enjoy a smooth and intuitive process for converting and accessing audiobooks.

Note: The [Book Bits](https://bookbits.wowen.tech/) demo showcase a tiny bit of the full software and functionality. For demo purposes, the professional audiobook voice model has a 550-character limit for user testing – for longer testing we utilizes a cheap, basic, and robotic voice to illustrate functionality.

Book Bits is built by [Emma Hager (@uchusei)](https://github.com/uchusei), founder of [WOWEN](https://wowen.tech/).
